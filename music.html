				<p>In high school Ian was heavily involved in the music department, playing in the symphonic band, jazz band, jazz combo, and chamber choir ensembles. These ensembles went to a number of festivals, and Ian got to go to locations such as Banff, Seattle, and Loon Lake for performances, and to mentor younger students.</p>
