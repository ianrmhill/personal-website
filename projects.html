				<p>Since he was 3 months old, Ian has gone on a sailing trip every summer, which has shaped a lot of his life. Fishing, swimming, sailing, skiing, and scuba diving have all become some of his favourite activities. Some of his most memorable experiences include sailing through the night on the Georgia Straight, skiing an empty mountain at Manning Park, swimming in Black Lake in Desolation Sound, and going on a night dive to see manta rays in Hawaii.</p>

				<p>This website was developed in HTML and CSS by Ian as a personal project during his winter 2016 work term. The experience has helped him learn about design philosophy and colour scheming, and two new programming languages. Once 2A is completed he hopes to update the site to use proper web development techniques, potentially using nodejs with react.</p>
