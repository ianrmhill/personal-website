			<p>This website was developed in HTML and CSS by Ian as a personal project during his winter 2016 work term. The experience has helped him learn about design philosophy and colour scheming, and two new programming languages. Once 2A is completed he hopes to update the site to use proper web development techniques, potentially using nodejs with react.</p>
