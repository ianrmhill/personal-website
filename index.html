				<p>Born in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1997, Ian Hill lived in the False Creek area for the first 18 years of his life, attending False Creek Elementary and Point Grey Secondary. At Point Grey, Ian also had the privilege of being accepted into the Point Grey Mini enrichment program, which gave him the opportunity to go on incredible trips to Bamfield marine science station, Strathcona national park, Manning Park ski resort, and the chance to organize large events for the school.</p>

				<p>Thanks to his parents, Ian had the opportunity to develop his skills and hobbies from a young age, and began classical guitar and league soccer at the age of 6, dinghy sailing at 9, trumpet at 12, and scuba diving at the age of 17. His father Simon also introduced him to magnetism, simple circuits, Lego, and handywork at a very young age, fostering a love of design and science.</p>
