      While semiconductors are increasingly used to control safety-critical systems, transistors are shrinking to where single atom defects significantly affect aging. Current industrial and research methods for evaluating reliability are not rigorous enough in quantifying the uncertainty of predictions or modelling complex sources of variability, risking un-expected aging-induced failures in critical next-generation products. This research introduces several on-chip aging sensors that track the progression of different transistor defect formation physics, a probabilistic physics modelling framework that carefully incorporates uncertainty and variability, and an experimental design approach to optimize accelerated stress tests to meet rigorous reliability requirements with consideration for engineering costs and risks. Custom semiconductor chips and sophisticated probabilistic programming techniques are used to implement the research contributions, which are then validated through tests and detailed case studies. These contributions represent key components towards a comprehensive qualification strategy for ensuring safe long-term operation of atomic-scale transistors in critical applications.

Music:

      As a hobbyist musician, finding time for what you love can be a challenge, and finding the energy to actually record and distribute that music is an even greater challenge. Ian has been playing music since the age of six, starting with the classical guitar, but only began working significantly on musical production in 2020.

       Ian's first foray into modern production and pop-style music represents a major milestone in his musician's journey. The track is all Ian's work, from lyrics to composition to instruments to singing to production to mix and then master, and it was all done in his bedroom. This snapshot of his musical progress has lots going on for listeners to find including bass harmonics, subtle guitar harmonies, and a happy cat. "Doubt" is the first but certainly not the last, with other compositions in the works that should get better and better as his experience grows. More to come in the future, hope you enjoy listening!

      This album is a one-man COVID lockdown adventure into microphone placement, careful listening, and frustrating takes. The result is an authentic 40 minutes of classical guitar repertoire performed in a living room. No church acoustics, virtually no audio processing, and all the imperfections of live performance and home recording. Ian plays a Steve Ganz guitar and recorded the album with a stereo pair of Rode M5 microphones.

      An in-progress ambient album inspired by beach sunsets, dusky summer skies, opulent estates, and ominous breezes. Obido will bring classical guitar to a unique setting. A sketch of the overall composition is complete, but lots of effort remains to bring this album to life.

      Some short-form videos can be found on Ian's Instagram along with a few full playthrough videos on his Youtube channel, which show not just how the guitar sounds but also how the passages are played. New little compositions and covers are added over time!

      Learning to imbibe! More of an ongoing journey than a set project, getting better at making cocktails has been a fun hobby to break up the time between more technical projects. Guest reviews:

      Not one to get left behind (and one who dislikes JavaScript), this website was constructed using Anthropics's Claude Code with very little manual intervention. Starting with a raw HTML + CSS template he built back in 2016, Ian leveraged generative AI to build out the features and design of this site. Software engineering experience was highly valuable in helping point Claude in the right directions for efficient structure, implementation, and bug fixes. Without a strong technical background and practice scoping out bite-size tasks, many features would be missing or much harder to achieve, such as directing Claude to use dynamic content loaded from a YAML file for easy future website content updates.
